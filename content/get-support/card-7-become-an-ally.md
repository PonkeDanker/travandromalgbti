# How to Become an Ally

### How to be an LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma Ally?

- Start the conversations about it’s OK to be an LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma. Have these conversations with people you know!

- Realise we, LGBTI+ Travellers & Roma, are your family!

- Use language which includes all kinds of people who love all kinds of people - don’t just talk about boys having girlfriends; talk about boys having boyfriends and girls having girlfriends and that’s OK. 

- Don’t wait- come out as an LGBT ally! How else will people know you are supportive if you don’t say you are?

- Defend LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma in conversations or comments you hear when they use insulting words or language - don’t stay silent.

- Stand up for and with LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma - for example go to Pride with them!

### What can Traveller & Roma organsations do?

- Create positive visibility for LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma in your spaces and make spaces for LGBTI+ issues, conversations and people in your organisation. For example, put up the LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma Pride poster.

- Challenge the fear around LGBTI+ issues & correct wrong information.

- Show you support LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma and their families.

- Challenge the shame around LGBTI+ issues - there is nothing shameful about being true to who you are.

- Be aware as an organisation that the wider Traveller or Roma communities may push back against you for supporting LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma and be ready to deal with that.

- Put in place LGBTI+ Awareness Training for your organisation & then make a policy for ‘being an LGBTI+ Ally’ in your organisation.

- Finally make a ‘Critical Incident Policy’ which spells out what to do, where to signpost someone when they are at risk and in need of support.
