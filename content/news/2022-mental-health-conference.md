The National Action Group for LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma Rights had a stand at the Traveller Mental Health Conference. We were happy to see a huge interest in our resources and the newly published Peer-Research 'Unveiling Inequality'. With the research showing that LGBTI+ Travellers experience high levels of homelesseness, harassment and mental health issues, we want to make sure their mental health needs are considered. 

Minister Mary Butler and all CHO areas were provided with the Peer-Research report 'Unveiling Inequality' and during a workshop we were able to engage in conversation with wonderful staff members from Traveller organsations around the country.
