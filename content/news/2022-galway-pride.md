In August, the National Action Group for LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma Rights proudly walked with Galway Traveller Movement in Galway's Pride Parade. It was a proud moment to see so many engaged staff members of GTM and more allies to LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma from the Traveller community walk for Pride and to champion LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma. Leaving from city hall, our walk down to Fr. Burke Park was accompanied by cheers and great support from spectators. Let's continue to celebrate diversity in the LGBTI+ communinity and Ireland.
