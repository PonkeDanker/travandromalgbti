The National Action Group for LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma Rights proudly launched  the Peer-Research "Unveiling Inequality - Experiences of LGBTI+ Travellers and Roma", a peer-research project to explore and make visible the experience of exclusion of LGBTI+ Travellers and Roma as well as capture the love and acceptance that some LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma describe as receiving from their families and loved ones.

The IHERC funded peer-to-peer research looks at the lived experience of LGBTI+ Travellers and Roma in Ireland and unveils how LGBTI+ Travellers and Roma face homophobia, anti-Traveller racism and a combination of the two in their own communities, the LGBTI+ community & the wider society.

The National Action Group for LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma Rights had a stand at the Traveller Mental Health Conference. We were happy to see a huge interest in our resources and the newly puiblished Peer-Research 'Unveiling Inequality'. With the research showing that LGBTI+ Travellers experience high levels of homelesseness, harassment and mental health issues, we want to make sure their mental health needs are considered. 

Minister Mary Butler and all CHO areas were provided with the Peer-Research report 'Unveiling Inequality' and during a workshop we were able to engage in conversation with wonderful staff members from Traveller organsiations around the country.
