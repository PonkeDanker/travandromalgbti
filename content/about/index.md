# About us

The National Action Group for LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma Rights is a collective that aims to increase the promotion, protection, inclusion and celebration of LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma individuals and their families - within their communities and within Traveller & Roma and LGBTI+ organisations and services.

# What is *intersectionality*

We inform about and promote awareness for the intersectional experience of LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma. *Intersectionality* refers to the fact that multiple affiliation with marginalised groups lead to an experience of overlapping and reinforcing discrimination and prejudice. 

LGBTI+ Travellers and Roma often face homophobia, anti-Traveller and anti-Roma racism and a combination of the two in their own communities, the LGBTI+ community & the wider society.

For example, an LGBTI+ Traveller or Roma may encounter racism by the LGBTI+ community & may encounter exclusion and prejudice by the Traveller or Roma community for being LGBTI+ & be discrimintaed against by the wider society for both simultaneously.
