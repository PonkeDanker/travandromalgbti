# About us

## Our Vision and Mission

The National Action Group for LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma Rights is a colletive that aims to increase the promotion, protection, inclusion and celebration of LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma individuals and their families - within their communities and within Traveller & Roma and LGBTI+ organisations and services.

## What is *intersectionality*

We inform and promote awareness for the intersectional experience of LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma. *Intersectionality* refers to the fact that multiple affiliation with marginalised groups lead to an experience of overlapping and reinforcing discrimination and prejudice. 

For example, an LGBTI+ Traveller or Roma may encounter racism by the LGBTI+ community & may encounter exclusion and prejudice by the Traveller or Roma community for being LGBTI+ & be discrimintaed against by the wider society for both simultaneously.

## Governance & Membership

The **Steering Committee** consists of representatives from the LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma community, from national, regional and local Traveller & Roma organisations and services and LGBTI+ organisations and services.

**Membership** consists of 
- LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma individuals
- Traveller individuals
- Politicians
- Traveller organisations and services
- LGBTI+ organisations and services
- Other Human Rights related organisations and services.
