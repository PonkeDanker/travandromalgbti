# For Parents & Carers

#### Love your child!

##### Is your child struggling with their sexual identity or gender? Did they just tell you that they are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender or is your child intersex?

You may feel shock and fear, but you are not alone and it is ok to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex as a Traveller or Roma. LGBT+ Traveller and Roma live happy and fulfilled lives being true to both their identities as LGBT+ and as Traveller and Roma. What your child needs most now is your love and acceptance and the knowledge to live a full life in your community. There are many resources out there and people you can talk to, to find out how to best to cope with your worries and to support your child in your family and community
