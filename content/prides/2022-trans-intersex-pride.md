Long-term Ally Marry McDonagh read out a speech of Trans Traveller Mike at the Trans- and Intersex Pride in Dublin in July. 

The speech was subsequently published by Gay Ireland News & Entertainment (GCN) in their August issue. Have a look at page 45. Thanks to GCN for promoting and championing Trans Traveller rights!
