##### Dublin Pride

Every year on the third weekend of June, the National Action Group for LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma Rights participates in the **Dublin Pride Parade**. 

LGBTI+ Travellers & Roma, our members & allies walk together to celebrate Community Pride, Family Pride, LGBTI+ Pride and Traveller & Roma Pride!

See our [Pride gallery](/what-we-do/prides) for past parades.
