# What We Do

## Information and Support

We provide information and support to LGBTI+ Traveller & Roma, their families & organisations.

See our [Get Information & Support](/get-support) page.

## Prides

##### Dublin Pride

Every year on the third weekend of June, we participate in the **Dublin Pride Parade**. 

LGBTI+ Travellers & Roma, our members & allies walk together to celebrate Community Pride, Family Pride, LGBTI+ Pride and Traveller & Roma Pride!

See our [Pride gallery](/what-we-do/prides) for past parades.

- Sligo Pride 2022
- Trans- and Intersex Pride 2022

## Research

In 2021, we commissioned a peer-research ‘Unveiling Inequality – The Experiences of LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma’  with the goal of advancing greater awareness and understanding of Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender, Intersex and Queer (LGBTI+) Traveller & Roma and supporting their inclusion in organisations and services and in their communities. 

The study is gratefully supported by LGBT Ireland and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC).
