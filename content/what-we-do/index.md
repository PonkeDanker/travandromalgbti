## Research

In 2021, the National Action Group for LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma Rights commissioned a peer-research ‘Unveiling Inequality – The Experiences of LGBTI+ Traveller and Roma’  with the goal to unveil the isolation experienced by LGBTI+ Travellers and Roma, with the
aim of creating an Ireland which is more LGBTI+ Travellers and Roma inclusive.
